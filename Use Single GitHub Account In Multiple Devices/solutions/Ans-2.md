Thatâ€™s a great question!

You should add **both machines' public keys** to GitHub.

Hereâ€™s why: Each machine has its own SSH key pair (private and public), and GitHub uses the **public key** to recognize which device is allowed to access your repositories.

### ðŸ“Œ **How to do it:**

1. On **Machine A**:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the output.

2. Go to **GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG Keys â†’ New SSH Key**.

- Title: **Machine A (e.g., Laptop)**
- Key: Paste the public key

3. On **Machine B**:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the output.

4. Add another key on GitHub:

- Title: **Machine B (e.g., Desktop)**
- Key: Paste the public key

### ðŸ›œ **Verify the setup:**

On each machine, test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful:

```
Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...
```

Now both machines can push and pull from your GitHub repositories without interfering with each other!

Would you like me to walk you through managing multiple SSH keys if you use multiple GitHub accounts? Let me know! ðŸš€

# Doubt:

What if I generate **one** `public key` and `private key` and share or copy the same `public key` and `private key` on both machine will it work. [Ans-3](https://github.com/hameed003/git-and-gitHub-notes/blob/main/Use%20Single%20GitHub%20Account%20In%20Multiple%20Devices/solutions/Ans-3.md)
