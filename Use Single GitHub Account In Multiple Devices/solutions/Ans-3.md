Yes, that will work â€” but itâ€™s not the best practice!

Let me explain:

### âœ… **What Happens If You Use the Same Key Pair on Both Machines?**

- If you generate a single SSH key pair (public and private) on **Machine A**, and then copy both the public (`id_ed25519.pub`) and private (`id_ed25519`) keys to **Machine B**, it will still work.
- GitHub will see the same public key regardless of which machine youâ€™re using, so youâ€™ll be able to push, pull, and clone without issues.

Hereâ€™s how youâ€™d do it:

1. **On Machine A:**  
   Generate SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Copy the private key to Machine B:

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@machineB:~/.ssh/
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@machineB:~/.ssh/
```

Or manually copy the contents and save them in the right location.

2. **On Machine B:**  
   Ensure the permissions are correct:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Start the SSH agent and add the key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. **Test the connection on both machines:**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### ðŸš© **Why This Isnâ€™t Recommended (and Whatâ€™s Better)**

1. **Security Risk:** If one machine is compromised, both machines are at risk since they share the same private key.
2. **Difficult to Revoke:** If you ever need to revoke access for one machine, youâ€™d have to remove the shared key, locking out both devices.
3. **Lack of Traceability:** If you push from both machines, the same key will show up, so you canâ€™t distinguish which machine made the push.

**Better Approach:**  
Generate separate key pairs for each machine and add both public keys to GitHub. This way, if one machine is compromised, you only need to remove that machineâ€™s key.
