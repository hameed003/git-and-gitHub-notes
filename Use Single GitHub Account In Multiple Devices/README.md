# Way to use GitHub on multiple machines with SSH

Letâ€™s break this down step by step! Iâ€™ll show you the most secure and scalable way to use GitHub on multiple machines with SSH, so you can switch between them seamlessly.

Hereâ€™s how to do it the **right way**:

---

## ðŸ”‘ **Step 1: Generate SSH Keys on Each Machine**

1. **On Machine A (e.g., your laptop):**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Press **Enter** to save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).  
Leave the passphrase empty (or set one for extra security).

Then view your public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the entire output.

2. **On Machine B (e.g., your desktop):**
   Repeat the same steps:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

View the public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

## ðŸ›œ **Step 2: Add SSH Keys to GitHub**

1. **Log in to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG Keys â†’ New SSH Key**

2. **Add the key from Machine A:**

- Title: **Laptop (or whatever makes sense)**
- Paste the public key

3. **Add the key from Machine B:**

- Title: **Desktop**
- Paste the public key

---

## ðŸš€ **Step 3: Configure SSH on Each Machine**

1. **On Machine A:**  
   Tell your SSH client to use the correct private key:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add this:

```
# GitHub from Laptop
Host github-laptop
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

2. **On Machine B:**  
   Do the same, but change the **host name**:

```
# GitHub from Desktop
Host github-desktop
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Save the file.

---

## âœ… **Step 4: Test the Connection**

1. **On Machine A:**

```bash
ssh -T github-laptop
```

2. **On Machine B:**

```bash
ssh -T github-desktop
```

If everything is set up correctly, youâ€™ll see this message:

```
Hi <username>! Youâ€™ve successfully authenticated...
```

---

## ðŸ”— **Step 5: Clone and Push Repositories**

1. **On Machine A (laptop):**

```bash
git clone git@github-laptop:username/repository.git
```

2. **On Machine B (desktop):**

```bash
git clone git@github-desktop:username/repository.git
```

Now you can work on your project from both machines, commit your changes, and push them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update from laptop"
git push
```

---

## ðŸš© **Why This Setup is Secure and Scalable**

- **Separate Keys for Each Machine:** If one device is lost or compromised, you only need to remove that deviceâ€™s key from GitHub.
- **Clear Device Identification:** You can see which device made a commit or push.
- **No Need to Manually Switch Keys:** The SSH config handles the correct key selection for you.
