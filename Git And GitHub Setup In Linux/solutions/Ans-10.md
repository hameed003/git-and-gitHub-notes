The command `git config --global credential.helper store` is used to configure Git to **save your credentials (username and personal access token, or PAT)** in a **plain text file** on your disk. This allows you to avoid entering your credentials repeatedly when performing Git operations (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`, `git pull`).

---

### **When to Use `git config --global credential.helper store`**

You should use this command **before entering your PAT**. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Purpose of the Command**:

   - The `store` credential helper saves your credentials to a file (`~/.git-credentials` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials` on Windows).
   - It does this **after you enter your credentials for the first time**.

2. **How It Works**:

   - Once you set the `store` credential helper, Git will:
     - Prompt you for your credentials (username and PAT) the first time you perform an operation that requires authentication (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`).
     - Save those credentials to the `.git-credentials` file.
     - Automatically use the saved credentials for future Git operations.

3. **If You Set It After Entering PAT**:
   - If you set the `store` credential helper **after** entering your PAT, Git will not have saved your credentials, and youâ€™ll need to enter them again the next time.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Set the Credential Helper (Before Entering PAT)**

Run the following command to configure the `store` credential helper:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

#### **2. Perform a Git Operation**

Perform a Git operation that requires authentication, such as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

or

```bash
git push origin main
```

#### **3. Enter Your Credentials**

- When prompted, enter your:
  - **Username**: Your GitHub username.
  - **Password**: Your **personal access token (PAT)** (not your GitHub account password).

#### **4. Credentials Are Saved**

- Git will save your credentials in the `.git-credentials` file.
- The next time you perform a Git operation, Git will automatically use the saved credentials.

---

### **Where Are Credentials Stored?**

- **On Windows**:
  - The credentials are stored in:
    ```
    C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials
    ```
- **On Linux/Mac**:
  - The credentials are stored in:
    ```
    ~/.git-credentials
    ```

---

### **Security Considerations**

The `store` credential helper saves your credentials in **plain text**. This is less secure than other options like **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** or **SSH**. Hereâ€™s what you should keep in mind:

1. **Risk of Exposure**:

   - If someone gains access to your computer, they can read your credentials from the `.git-credentials` file.

2. **Use SSH for Better Security**:

   - If security is a concern, consider using **SSH** instead of HTTPS. SSH uses cryptographic keys for authentication and does not require storing credentials in plain text.

3. **Use Git Credential Manager (GCM)**:
   - On Windows, GCM securely stores your credentials in the **Windows Credential Manager**. Itâ€™s a more secure alternative to the `store` helper.

---

### **When to Use `store` Credential Helper**

Use the `store` credential helper if:

- Youâ€™re working on a **personal machine** and are comfortable with the security implications.
- You want a simple solution to avoid entering your credentials repeatedly.
- Youâ€™re not using SSH or GCM.

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. Set the credential helper:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

2. Clone a repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```

3. Enter your credentials when prompted:

   - **Username**: `hameed008`
   - **Password**: `<Your PAT>`

4. Push changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   - You wonâ€™t be prompted for credentials again because theyâ€™re saved in `.git-credentials`.

---

### **Switching to a More Secure Option**

If you decide to switch to a more secure option later, you can:

#### **Use Git Credential Manager (GCM)**:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

#### **Use SSH**:

1. Generate an SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the public key:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to **GitHub Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** and add the key.
3. Update your remote URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```

---

### **Summary**

- Use `git config --global credential.helper store` **before entering your PAT**.
- This command saves your credentials in a plain text file so you donâ€™t have to enter them repeatedly.
- Be aware of the security implications of using the `store` credential helper.
- Consider using **SSH** or **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** for better security.
