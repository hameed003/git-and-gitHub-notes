When you run the command `git config --global credential.helper`, it is expected to **not produce any output** if the credential helper is not set or if the command is simply querying the current configuration. This is normal behavior for Git.

Let me explain what this command does, why there's no output, and how you can check or set the credential helper properly.

---

### **What Does `git config --global credential.helper` Do?**

This command checks the **global Git configuration** to see which **credential helper** is currently set. A credential helper is a tool that Git uses to store or cache your credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, or personal access tokens) so you donâ€™t have to enter them repeatedly.

---

### **Why Is There No Output?**

1. **No Credential Helper Set**:

   - If no credential helper is configured, the command will not return any output. This means Git is not using any helper to store or cache your credentials.

2. **Command Is Querying, Not Setting**:
   - The command `git config --global credential.helper` is used to **query** the current credential helper, not to set it. If you want to set a credential helper, you need to provide a value (e.g., `store`, `cache`, or `manager-core`).

---

### **How to Check the Current Credential Helper**

To check if a credential helper is set, you can use the following command:

```bash
git config --global --get credential.helper
```

- If a credential helper is set, it will return the name of the helper (e.g., `manager-core`, `store`, or `cache`).
- If no credential helper is set, it will return no output.

---

### **How to Set a Credential Helper**

If no credential helper is set, you can configure one based on your needs. Here are the most common options:

#### **1. Git Credential Manager (Recommended for Windows)**

Git Credential Manager (GCM) is the default credential helper for Git on Windows. It securely stores your credentials and integrates with Windows Credential Manager.

To set it:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

#### **2. Store Credential Helper**

This stores your credentials in a **plain text file** on your disk. Itâ€™s less secure but simple to use.

To set it:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

- Credentials are saved in `~/.git-credentials` (on Linux/Mac) or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials` (on Windows).

#### **3. Cache Credential Helper**

This caches your credentials in memory for a short period of time (default: 15 minutes).

To set it:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

- You can specify a timeout (in seconds) like this:
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  ```
  This caches credentials for 1 hour (3600 seconds).

---

### **Verify the Credential Helper Is Set**

After setting a credential helper, you can verify it by running:

```bash
git config --global --get credential.helper
```

This should now return the name of the credential helper you set (e.g., `manager-core`, `store`, or `cache`).

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. Set the credential helper to `manager-core` (recommended for Windows):

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper manager-core
   ```

2. Verify the credential helper:

   ```bash
   git config --global --get credential.helper
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   manager-core
   ```

3. Perform a Git operation that requires authentication (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```
   - The first time, youâ€™ll be prompted for your credentials (username and personal access token).
   - The credentials will be securely stored by the credential helper, so you wonâ€™t need to enter them again.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

1. **No Credential Helper Set**:

   - If `git config --global --get credential.helper` returns no output, you need to set a credential helper (see above).

2. **Credentials Not Being Saved**:

   - Ensure youâ€™re using the correct credential helper.
   - If using `store`, check the `.git-credentials` file to see if credentials are being saved.
   - If using `manager-core`, check the **Windows Credential Manager** for stored credentials.

3. **Incorrect Credentials**:
   - If youâ€™re using a password, note that GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication for Git operations. Use a **personal access token (PAT)** instead.

---

### **Summary**

- The command `git config --global credential.helper` checks the current credential helper but does not produce output if none is set.
- Use `git config --global --get credential.helper` to explicitly check the current helper.
- Set a credential helper (e.g., `manager-core`, `store`, or `cache`) to avoid repeatedly entering credentials.
