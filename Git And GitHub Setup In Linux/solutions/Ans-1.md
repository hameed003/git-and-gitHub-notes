The error you're encountering, `remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021`, occurs because GitHub no longer allows password-based authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. Instead, GitHub requires the use of **personal access tokens (PATs)** or **SSH keys** for authentication.

This issue might appear only on Linux and not on Windows because:

1. **Credential Managers**: Windows often uses Git Credential Manager, which automatically handles authentication (e.g., using a PAT or OAuth token). Linux does not have this by default.
2. **Cached Credentials**: Your Windows system might have cached credentials (e.g., a PAT or SSH key), while your Linux system does not.

Below, I'll explain how to resolve this issue on Linux and set up proper authentication for GitHub.

### **Solution 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for HTTPS Authentication**

GitHub no longer allows password-based authentication for HTTPS Git operations. Instead, you need to generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** and use it as your password.

#### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):**

   - Go to your GitHub account settings: [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
   - Navigate to **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
   - Click **Generate new token**.
   - Select the appropriate scopes (e.g., `repo` for full control of private repositories, `workflow` for GitHub Actions, etc.).
   - Click **Generate token**.
   - Copy the token (you won’t be able to see it again after closing the page).

2. **Use the PAT for Git Operations:**

   - When you clone, push, or pull using HTTPS, use the PAT as your password.
   - For example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
     ```
     When prompted for a username and password:
     - **Username**: Your GitHub username.
     - **Password**: Paste the PAT (not your GitHub account password).

3. **Cache the PAT (Optional):**
   To avoid entering the PAT every time, you can cache it using Git's credential helper:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

   After running this command, the next time you enter your PAT, Git will save it in plain text in `~/.git-credentials`.

   **Note**: Caching credentials in plain text is not the most secure option. For better security, use SSH (see Solution 2 below).

### **Solution 2: Use SSH for Authentication**

SSH is a more secure and convenient way to authenticate with GitHub. It uses cryptographic keys instead of passwords or tokens.

#### Steps to Set Up SSH Authentication:

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair:**
   If you don’t already have an SSH key, generate one:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   - Press Enter to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
   - Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

2. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent:**
   Start the SSH agent and add your private key:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:**

   - Copy the public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to your GitHub account settings: [GitHub SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   - Click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste the public key into the "Key" field and give it a title.
   - Click **Add SSH key**.

4. **Clone or Push Using SSH:**
   - Use the SSH URL for Git operations instead of HTTPS. For example:
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
     ```
   - If you already cloned the repository using HTTPS, you can switch the remote URL to SSH:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
     ```

### **Why This Happens Only on Linux**

1. **Credential Manager**:

   - On Windows, Git often comes with **Git Credential Manager** (GCM), which handles authentication automatically (e.g., using OAuth or cached credentials).
   - On Linux, Git does not include a credential manager by default, so you need to manually configure authentication (e.g., using a PAT or SSH).

2. **Cached Credentials**:
   - If you previously authenticated on Windows, your credentials might be cached in the credential manager. On Linux, there is no such cache unless you explicitly set it up (e.g., using `git config --global credential.helper store`).

---

### **Summary of Solutions**

1. **Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:

   - Generate a PAT from GitHub.
   - Use the PAT as your password for HTTPS Git operations.
   - Optionally, cache the PAT using `git config --global credential.helper store`.

2. **Use SSH Authentication**:

   - Generate an SSH key pair.
   - Add the public key to your GitHub account.
   - Use SSH URLs for Git operations.

3. **Switch from HTTPS to SSH**:
   If you already cloned a repository using HTTPS, switch to SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```

---

### **Recommendation**

- **Use SSH**: It’s more secure and convenient for frequent Git operations.
- **Use PATs for HTTPS**: If you prefer HTTPS, use a PAT and cache it securely.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the authentication issue on Linux and continue using Git and GitHub seamlessly. Let me know if you need further assistance!
