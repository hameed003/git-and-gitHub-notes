In Windows, Git credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, or personal access tokens) are typically stored and managed by the **Git Credential Manager (GCM)**. The location and method of accessing these credentials depend on how Git is configured on your system.

Below, I’ll explain where and how you can view your cached Git credentials in Windows.

---

### **1. Using Git Credential Manager (GCM)**

Git Credential Manager (GCM) is the default credential helper for Git on Windows. It securely stores your credentials and automatically retrieves them when needed.

#### **View Credentials via Windows Credential Manager**

GCM stores credentials in the **Windows Credential Manager**. Here’s how to access them:

1. Open the **Windows Credential Manager**:

   - Press `Win + S` and search for **Credential Manager**.
   - Alternatively, go to **Control Panel** > **User Accounts** > **Credential Manager**.

2. Navigate to **Windows Credentials**:

   - In the Credential Manager, click on **Windows Credentials**.

3. Look for GitHub Credentials:

   - Scroll down to the **Generic Credentials** section.
   - Look for entries related to GitHub. They will typically have names like:
     - `git:https://github.com`
     - `github.com`

4. View or Edit Credentials:
   - Click on the entry to expand it.
   - You can view the **Username** and **Password** (or personal access token).
   - If needed, you can edit or remove the credentials.

### **2. Using Git Config and Credential Helper**

If you’re using a different credential helper (e.g., `store` or `cache`), the credentials might be stored in a file or cached temporarily.

#### **Check Git Config for Credential Helper**

Run the following command to check which credential helper is configured:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper
```

- If it returns `manager-core`, it means Git Credential Manager (GCM) is being used (see the steps above).
- If it returns `store`, credentials are stored in a plain text file.
- If it returns `cache`, credentials are temporarily cached in memory.

#### **Locate Stored Credentials (if using `store`)**

If the credential helper is set to `store`, credentials are stored in a plain text file at:

```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials
```

You can open this file with a text editor to view the credentials. Be cautious, as this file contains sensitive information in plain text.

---

### **3. Using Command Line to View Credentials**

You can also use the command line to view cached credentials.

#### **Check Cached Credentials**

If you’re using the `cache` credential helper, you can check the cached credentials by running:

```bash
git credential-cache get
```

This will prompt Git to retrieve the cached credentials for the current session.

### **4. Using GitHub CLI (Optional)**

If you have the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed, you can check your authentication status and credentials.

1. Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed):

   - Download from [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

2. Check Authentication Status:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
   This will show you the authenticated GitHub account and the authentication method (e.g., HTTPS, SSH).

### **Summary of Credential Locations**

| **Credential Helper**        | **Location**                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Git Credential Manager (GCM) | Windows Credential Manager (`Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager`) |
| `store`                      | Plain text file at `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials`                     |
| `cache`                      | Temporarily cached in memory (use `git credential-cache get` to view)             |

---

### **Recommendations**

1. **Use Git Credential Manager (GCM)**:

   - It’s the most secure and convenient option for managing credentials on Windows.
   - It integrates with Windows Credential Manager and supports OAuth for GitHub.

2. **Avoid Plain Text Storage**:

   - If you’re using the `store` credential helper, consider switching to GCM for better security.

3. **Use SSH for Authentication**:
   - SSH keys are more secure and don’t require frequent credential input.
