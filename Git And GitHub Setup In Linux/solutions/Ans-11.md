The **credential helpers** in Git (`cache`, `store`, and `manager-core`) are tools that help manage your credentials (e.g., username, password, or personal access token) so you donâ€™t have to enter them repeatedly. However, they differ in how they store and handle your credentials. Letâ€™s break down the differences:

---

### **1. `cache` Credential Helper**

#### **How It Works**:

- The `cache` credential helper **temporarily stores your credentials in memory**.
- By default, credentials are cached for **15 minutes**, but you can configure a custom timeout.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Storage**: Credentials are stored in memory (RAM).
- **Persistence**: Credentials are lost when the cache timeout expires or the system is restarted.
- **Security**: Relatively secure because credentials are not stored on disk.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for short-term use, such as when youâ€™re working on a shared or public machine and donâ€™t want credentials to persist.

#### **How to Use**:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

- Set a custom timeout (e.g., 1 hour):
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  ```

---

### **2. `store` Credential Helper**

#### **How It Works**:

- The `store` credential helper **saves your credentials in a plain text file** on your disk.
- The file is located at:
  - On Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.git-credentials`
  - On Linux/Mac: `~/.git-credentials`

#### **Key Features**:

- **Storage**: Credentials are stored in a plain text file.
- **Persistence**: Credentials are saved indefinitely until the file is deleted or modified.
- **Security**: Less secure because credentials are stored in plain text. If someone gains access to your machine, they can read your credentials.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for personal machines where security is less of a concern and you want to avoid entering credentials repeatedly.

#### **How to Use**:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

---

### **3. `manager-core` (Git Credential Manager, GCM)**

#### **How It Works**:

- The `manager-core` credential helper is part of **Git Credential Manager (GCM)**, which securely stores your credentials.
- On Windows, GCM integrates with the **Windows Credential Manager**.
- On Linux/Mac, GCM uses the system's keychain (e.g., GNOME Keyring or macOS Keychain).

#### **Key Features**:

- **Storage**: Credentials are stored securely in the system's credential management tool (e.g., Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain).
- **Persistence**: Credentials are saved indefinitely unless explicitly removed.
- **Security**: Highly secure because credentials are encrypted and managed by the operating system.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for most users, especially on Windows, as it provides a secure and convenient way to manage credentials.

#### **How to Use**:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

| **Use Case**         | Short-term use on shared machines        | Personal machines with low security concerns | Most users, especially on Windows                        |
| **Ease of Use**      | Requires re-authentication after timeout | No re-authentication needed                  | No re-authentication needed                              |

### **When to Use Each Credential Helper**

#### **Use `cache` If**:

- Youâ€™re working on a shared or public machine.
- You want credentials to be stored temporarily and cleared after a short time.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  ```

#### **Use `store` If**:

- Youâ€™re working on a personal machine and are comfortable with the security implications.
- You want to avoid entering credentials repeatedly without worrying about timeouts.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper store
  ```

#### **Use `manager-core` If**:

- You want a secure and convenient way to manage credentials.
- Youâ€™re using Windows and want to leverage the **Windows Credential Manager**.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper manager-core
  ```

### **Switching Between Credential Helpers**

If you want to switch from one credential helper to another, you can reconfigure Git:

1. **Check Current Credential Helper**:

   ```bash
   git config --global --get credential.helper
   ```

2. **Change to a Different Helper**:

   - To switch to `cache`:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
     ```
   - To switch to `store`:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper store
     ```
   - To switch to `manager-core`:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper manager-core
     ```

3. **Clear Existing Credentials**:
   If you switch helpers, you may need to clear existing credentials:
   - For `store`, delete the `.git-credentials` file.
   - For `manager-core`, remove the credentials from the Windows Credential Manager or system keychain.

---

### **Summary**

- **`cache`**: Temporarily stores credentials in memory. Ideal for short-term use.
- **`store`**: Saves credentials in a plain text file. Convenient but less secure.
- **`manager-core`**: Securely stores credentials using the system's credential management tool. Highly secure and recommended for most users.
