If you ran the command `git config --global --get credential.helper` and got **no output**, it means that **no credential helper is explicitly set** in your global Git configuration. However, as I mentioned earlier, on Windows, **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** is often used by default even if itâ€™s not explicitly configured. Letâ€™s dive deeper into why this happens and how to verify or configure it.

---

### **Why No Output?**

1. **No Explicit Credential Helper Set**:

   - The command `git config --global --get credential.helper` checks the **global Git configuration** for a credential helper.
   - If no credential helper is explicitly set, it returns no output.

2. **Git Credential Manager (GCM) is Still Active**:
   - On Windows, Git installations often include **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** as the default credential helper, even if itâ€™s not explicitly configured in your Git config file.
   - GCM is automatically used because itâ€™s part of the Git for Windows installation package.

---

### **How to Verify if GCM is Being Used**

Even though `git config --global --get credential.helper` returns no output, GCM might still be active. Hereâ€™s how to verify:

#### **1. Check the System-Level Git Configuration**

GCM might be configured at the **system level** rather than the global level. Run:

```bash
git config --system --get credential.helper
```

- If this returns `manager-core`, it means GCM is configured at the system level.

#### **2. Check the Git Installation Directory**

GCM is often included in the Git installation directory. You can check if itâ€™s present:

- Navigate to the Git installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\libexec\git-core`).
- Look for a file named `git-credential-manager-core.exe` or `git-credential-manager.exe`.

#### **3. Test Git Operations**

- Perform a Git operation that requires authentication, such as:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```
- If youâ€™re prompted for your credentials and theyâ€™re saved for future use, GCM is likely active.

### **How to Explicitly Set a Credential Helper**

If you want to explicitly set a credential helper (e.g., GCM, `store`, or `cache`), you can do so using the following commands:

#### **1. Set Git Credential Manager (GCM)**:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

#### **2. Set Store Credential Helper**:

This saves credentials in a plain text file (less secure):

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

#### **3. Set Cache Credential Helper**:

This caches credentials in memory for a short time:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

- You can specify a timeout (e.g., 1 hour):
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  ```

---

### **Verify the Credential Helper After Setting It**

After setting a credential helper, verify it by running:

```bash
git config --global --get credential.helper
```

- If you set `manager-core`, the output will be:
  ```
  manager-core
  ```
- If you set `store`, the output will be:
  ```
  store
  ```

### **Why Are Credentials Still Saved Without a Credential Helper?**

If you didnâ€™t explicitly set a credential helper but your credentials are still being saved, itâ€™s because:

1. **GCM is Installed and Active by Default**:
   - Git for Windows includes GCM, and itâ€™s automatically used even if not explicitly configured.
2. **Windows Credential Manager Integration**:
   - GCM integrates with the **Windows Credential Manager** to securely store your credentials.

---

### **How to Disable GCM (If Needed)**

If you donâ€™t want to use GCM, you can disable it:

1. **Unset the Credential Helper**:

   ```bash
   git config --global --unset credential.helper
   ```

2. **Use a Different Credential Helper**:
   For example, to use the `store` helper:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

3. **Remove GCM from the System**:
   - If you want to completely remove GCM, you can uninstall it from the Git installation directory or reinstall Git without GCM.

---

### **Summary**

- If `git config --global --get credential.helper` returns no output, it means no credential helper is explicitly set in your global Git configuration.
- However, **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** is often used by default on Windows, even if not explicitly configured.
- To explicitly set a credential helper, use `git config --global credential.helper <value>`.
- To verify if GCM is active, check the system-level Git configuration or test Git operations.
