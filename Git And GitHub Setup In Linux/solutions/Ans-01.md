If you're using Windows and Git is not asking for a password when interacting with GitHub, it's likely because you have already configured Git to use a credential manager, which is automatically handling your authentication. The credential manager securely stores your GitHub credentials (username and Personal Access Token) and uses them without prompting you for a password each time you interact with GitHub.

Here's how you can configure Git to use a credential manager on Linux so that it behaves similarly to your Windows setup:

1. **Install Git Credential Manager (Linux)**:

   Git Credential Manager Core is a cross-platform tool that can be used to manage Git credentials on Linux. You can install it by following these steps:

   a. Download the latest release from the [Git Credential Manager Core GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/releases).

   b. Extract the downloaded archive.

   c. Run the installation script. You may need to use `sudo` depending on your system:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Git to Use Git Credential Manager**:

   After installing Git Credential Manager Core, configure Git to use it as the credential helper:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper manager-core
   ```

3. **Use Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**:

   With Git Credential Manager Core set up, you can continue to use Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as your authentication method. When you perform Git operations that require authentication, Git will automatically use the stored credentials from the manager.

4. **Verify the Setup**:

   To verify that Git Credential Manager Core is correctly configured and working, try performing a Git operation that requires authentication (e.g., push, pull) and see if it completes without prompting you for a password. If it works smoothly, you've successfully configured Git to use a credential manager on Linux.

Please note that the steps provided above may vary depending on your Linux distribution and the version of Git Credential Manager Core. Make sure to consult the documentation or instructions provided with the specific release you downloaded.

Once you've configured Git to use a credential manager on Linux, your authentication experience should be similar to what you're accustomed to on Windows, where you don't need to enter your password for each Git operation. Instead, the credential manager handles it automatically using the stored credentials (PAT).
