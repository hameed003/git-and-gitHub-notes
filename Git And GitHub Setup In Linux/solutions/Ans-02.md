If your Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub expires, you will not be able to use it for authentication, and you won't be able to push or pull code from GitHub until you regenerate and update your PAT with a new one. GitHub tokens, including PATs, have an expiration date for security reasons.

Here's what you should do if your PAT has expired:

1. **Generate a New PAT:**

   You need to generate a new Personal Access Token to replace the expired one. Follow these steps to generate a new PAT:

   a. Log in to your GitHub account.

   b. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select "Settings."

   c. In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."

   d. Click on "Personal access tokens" under "Access tokens."

   e. Click the "Generate token" button.

   f. Provide a name for your new token (e.g., "Git access token").

   g. Under "Select scopes," choose the permissions that this token will have. For basic Git operations, the "repo" scope is typically sufficient.

   h. Set an appropriate expiration period for the token. You can choose a token that doesn't expire, or you can set an expiration date depending on your security preferences.

   i. Scroll down and click the "Generate token" button.

   j. Copy the newly generated Personal Access Token. Be sure to save it in a secure location because GitHub will only show it once.

2. **Update Your Git Configuration:**

   After generating the new PAT, you'll need to update your Git configuration to use the new token. You can do this by running the following Git command on your local machine:

   ```bash
   git credential reject
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter your GitHub username, which you should provide, and then the expired PAT, which you should leave empty. Once you've done this, Git will forget the old credentials.

3. **Authenticate with the New PAT:**

   The next time you perform a Git operation that requires authentication (e.g., push or pull), you will be prompted for your GitHub username and password. Enter your GitHub username as usual, but use the new Personal Access Token as the password.

   Example:

   ```plaintext
   Username for 'https://github.com': yourusername
   Password for 'https://yourusername@github.com': <paste your new Personal Access Token here>
   ```

   After entering the new Personal Access Token, Git will authenticate you using the new token, and you'll be able to push and pull code from GitHub.

By following these steps, you can renew your authentication on GitHub by generating a new Personal Access Token and updating your Git configuration with the new token, allowing you to continue using Git seamlessly for your GitHub interactions.
