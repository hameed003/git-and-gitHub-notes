If you haven't explicitly set a **credential helper** in Git, but your credentials are still being saved in the **Windows Credential Manager**, itâ€™s likely because **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** is being used by default. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how this works and why your credentials are being saved:

---

### **1. Git Credential Manager (GCM) is Installed by Default**

When you install Git on Windows, the **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** is included and set as the default credential helper. This means:

- Even if you donâ€™t explicitly configure a credential helper, GCM is automatically used to manage your credentials.
- GCM securely stores your credentials in the **Windows Credential Manager**.

---

### **2. How GCM Works**

- **Automatic Integration**:

  - GCM integrates with Git and Windows Credential Manager out of the box.
  - When you perform a Git operation that requires authentication (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`), GCM prompts you for your credentials and saves them in the Windows Credential Manager.

- **Storage Location**:

  - Your credentials are stored in the **Windows Credential Manager** under **Windows Credentials**.
  - Look for entries like:
    - `git:https://github.com`
    - `github.com`

- **Authentication Method**:
  - If youâ€™re using HTTPS, GCM will prompt you for your **GitHub username** and **personal access token (PAT)** (or password, if it was saved before GitHub deprecated password-based authentication).
  - If youâ€™re using SSH, GCM is not involved because SSH uses key-based authentication.

---

### **3. Why You Donâ€™t Need to Explicitly Set a Credential Helper**

- **Default Behavior**:

  - On Windows, Git is preconfigured to use GCM as the credential helper. This is done during the Git installation process.
  - You donâ€™t need to manually set `credential.helper` unless you want to change the default behavior.

- **Check the Default Credential Helper**:
  To confirm that GCM is being used, run:
  ```bash
  git config --global --get credential.helper
  ```
  If the output is `manager-core`, it means GCM is being used.

### **4. How Credentials Are Saved in Windows Credential Manager**

When you perform a Git operation (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`):

1. Git prompts you for your credentials (username and PAT).
2. GCM intercepts the credentials and saves them securely in the **Windows Credential Manager**.
3. The next time you perform a Git operation, GCM retrieves the credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, so you donâ€™t need to enter them again.

---

### **5. Viewing Saved Credentials in Windows Credential Manager**

To view the credentials saved by GCM:

1. Open the **Windows Credential Manager**:

   - Press `Win + S` and search for **Credential Manager**.
   - Alternatively, go to **Control Panel** > **User Accounts** > **Credential Manager**.

2. Navigate to **Windows Credentials**:

   - Look for entries related to GitHub, such as:
     - `git:https://github.com`
     - `github.com`

3. View or Edit Credentials:
   - Click on an entry to expand it.
   - You can view the **Username** and **Password** (or PAT).
   - If needed, you can edit or remove the credentials.

---

### **6. What If You Donâ€™t Want to Use GCM?**

If you prefer not to use GCM, you can configure a different credential helper or disable it entirely.

#### **Disable GCM**:

To stop using GCM, you can unset the credential helper:

```bash
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

#### **Use a Different Credential Helper**:

For example, to use the `store` credential helper (which saves credentials in a plain text file):

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

---

### **7. Summary**

- **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** is installed and set as the default credential helper when you install Git on Windows.
- GCM automatically saves your credentials in the **Windows Credential Manager**.
- You donâ€™t need to explicitly set a credential helper because GCM is preconfigured.
- To verify or change the credential helper, use `git config --global --get credential.helper` or `git config --global credential.helper <value>`.
